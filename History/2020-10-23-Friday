==========
Empiricism

Using experiments to tell
true from false.

1800s Oxygen vs Phlogiston
1900s Nils Bohr

There is an art
to designing an
experiment


• “Falsifiability”
• Experiment design,
  good vs bad


filenames = [
    'taxes2011.csv',
    'taxes2010.csv',
    'taxes2009.csv',
    'taxes2012.csv',
]
filenames.sort()

False belief: “Look!
Earlier years come first,
it must be sorting by number.”

Experiment: ‘taxes9.csv’

Result: It isn’t sorting by
number, or `taxes9.csv` would
come first! It’s merely doing
dictionary order, character
by character.


You need to cultivate an
*adversarial* relationship
with beliefs


a = [[1, 'apple'], [2, 'orange']]
a.sort()



=============
Introspection

The Python language is
unusual: it lets programs
look at their own state

dir()
locals()

This can help more quickly
confirm or deny your guess
about what your program is
doing
