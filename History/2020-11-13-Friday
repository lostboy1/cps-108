Let’s add up the scores!

Problem:
The numbers are strings
and merely concatenate
when we try adding them


Note the good software
architecture of golf2.py:

Instead of a single loop
that extracts data AND
computes the average, it
uses a data structure —
a list — to turn those
into separate tasks.


=====
float

1 / 2 → 0.5

“floating point” numbers
are APPROXIMATE fractions
with a base-2 value and
exponent

But for our sake we
type them using decimals

1 - 1/3 - 1/3 - 1/3

1 - 0.333 - 0.333 - 0.333

Exponential notation (“e”):

1.0e3 means 1.0 × 10³
which means “one thousand”

1.0e-3 means 1.0 × 10⁻³
 which means “one thousandth”
