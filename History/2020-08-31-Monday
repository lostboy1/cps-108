  put results in your GitHub repository
  “10% / 20% … 100% done”
• Ctrl-P versus Shift-Ctrl-P

-----------
Exercise 16

• Loop *within* a loop!
• *Plus* remembering the winner.



import csv
winner_score = 0
winner_animal = ''
for state, animal in csv.reader(open('Data/state-animals.csv')):
    n = 0
    for state2, animal2 in csv.reader(open('Data/state-animals.csv')):
        if animal2 == animal:
            n = n + 1
    if n > winner_score:
        winner_score = n
        winner_animal = animal
print(winner_animal)
for state, animal in csv.reader(open('Data/state-animals.csv')):
    if animal == winner_animal:
        print(state)



--------
Notation

Old days: 𝑥 ← 𝑥 + 1
  Modern: x = x + 1



Since “=” was already used,
 the test had to be “==”

  x = 5   # sets “x” to 5
  x == 5  # “is x equal to 5?”

  if x = 5:   # SyntaxError
  if x == 5:  # correct



-------
Sorting

Remembering “<” and “>”:
   1,2,3  1 < 2 < 3
   a,b,c  a < b < c

print('Bison' < 'Coyote')

Bison / Coyote
Bison / Black bear
Bighorn sheep / Bison
Ant / Anteater
