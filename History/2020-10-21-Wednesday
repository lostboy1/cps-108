Quick review of Quiz 7


(Remember:
 if you are confused
 about the value of a name,
 you can just print() it)




===================
Thanks to the dict,
things are now easy



First try at Lesson 2 Exercise 16:

import csv
f = open('Data/state-animals.csv')
winning_count = 0
for state, animal in csv.reader(f):
    count = 0
    f2 = open('Data/state-animals.csv')
    for state2, animal2 in csv.reader(f2):
        if animal2 == animal:
            count = count + 1
    if count > winning_count:
        winning_count = count
        winner = animal
print(winning_count, winner)



Then we learned about the list:

import csv

f = open('Data/state-animals.csv')
animals = []
for state, animal in csv.reader(f):
    animals.append(animal)

winning_count = 0
for animal in animals:
    count = 0
    for animal2 in animals:
        if animal2 == animal:
            count = count + 1
    if count > winning_count:
        winning_count = count
        winner = animal

print(winning_count, winner)



Now we know about the dict.
It’s amazing!  We loop across
the file ONCE and get ALL the
animals out:

import csv

c = {}
f = open('Data/state-animals.csv')
for state, animal in csv.reader(f):
    c[animal] = c.get(animal, 0) + 1

winning_count = 0
for animal, count in c.items():
    if count > winning_count:
        winning_count = count
        winner = animal

print(winning_count, winner)



==================
Lists within lists


What if you wanted
the 5 MOST POPULAR
state animals?

a = [
  [3, 'Bison'],
  [1, 'Orca'],
  [2, 'Sheep'],
  [1, 'Moose'],
]
a.sort()
print(a)

Try:
print(a[-1])
print(a[0])
for score, animal in a[-2:]:
    print(score, animal)
for score, animal in a[:2]:
    print(score, animal)


What does this allow?

NO MORE KEEPING
UP WITH THE WINNER!


import csv
c = {}
f = open('Data/state-animals.csv')
for state, animal in csv.reader(f):
    c[animal] = c.get(animal, 0) + 1
items = []
for animal, count in c.items():
    items.append([count, animal])
items.sort()
print('5 most popular state animals:\n')
for count, animal in items[-5:]:
    print(count, animal)

Handing off a data
structure controls
program COMPLEXITY

“What are the 10 most popular
 movie roles of all time?”

import csv
c = {}
f = open('Data/movie-cast.csv')
for movie, rank, actor, character in csv.reader(f):
    c[character] = c.get(character, 0) + 1
items = []
for string, count in c.items():
    items.append([count, string])
items.sort()
for count, string in items[-10:]:
    print(count, string)



“What roles does Daniel
 Craig play most often?”

import csv
c = {}
f = open('Data/movie-cast.csv')
for movie, rank, actor, character in csv.reader(f):
    if actor == 'Daniel Craig':
        c[character] = c.get(character, 0) + 1
items = []
for string, count in c.items():
    items.append([count, string])
items.sort()
for count, string in items[-10:]:
    print(count, string)



“Who has played ‘James Bond’
 most often?”

import csv
c = {}
f = open('Data/movie-cast.csv')
for movie, rank, actor, character in csv.reader(f):
    if character == 'James Bond':
        c[actor] = c.get(actor, 0) + 1
items = []
for string, count in c.items():
    items.append([count, string])
items.sort()
for count, string in items[-10:]:
    print(count, string)
