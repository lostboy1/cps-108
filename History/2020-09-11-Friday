Git:
Distributed Version Control



=================
“Version Control”

Keeps a backup of every
previous version of a file



• Recover deleted code
• Recover old versions
• Roll back a release
• Bisection search for bugs

• Movies CSV *too big* for GitHub
• So, git push failed
• But further commits only *increase*
  the amount of data sent to GitHub
• So we need to *edit history*



=================
“Distributed”


• Your local copy
• My local copy
• GitHub’s central copy



• I’ve pushed a *new version*
  with a .gitignore file
• The instructions in the email ask
  you to *undo* your big Wednesday
  commit, pull my new one, then
  try again


=====
Today

• Follow email instructions
  to get unstuck!
• After you have successfully
  pushed, work on Lesson 5!
