=========================
Functions and Refactoring


Remember Lesson 2?

> Print the state animal of Texas.
> Print the state animal of Virginia.
> Print every state whose animal is the “Beaver”.
> Print every animal that is some kind of “seal”.
> Print every animal that is some kind of “whale”.
> Print every state whose animal is some kind of “bear”.

“Print the state animal of Texas.”

--

import csv
for state, animal in csv.reader(open('Data/state-animals.csv')):
    if state == 'Texas':
        print(animal)

--

import csv
animals = csv.reader(open('Data/state-animals.csv'))

animals2 = []
for state, animal in animals:
    if state == 'Texas':
        animals2.append([state, animal])

for state, animal in animals2:
    print(animal)

--

We might imagine turning
these into general tools:

import csv

def load():
    return csv.reader(open('Data/state-animals.csv'))

def state_equals(pattern, states_and_animals):
    matches = []
    for state, animal in states_and_animals:
        if state == pattern:
            matches.append([state, animal])
    return matches

def print_animals(states_and_animals):
    for state, animal in states_and_animals:
        print(animal)

Then we could:

# Print the state animal of Texas.
rows = load()
rows2 = state_equals('Texas', rows)
print_animals(rows2)

# Or, making the values "anonymous"
# by not stopping to assign a name
# to each one:
print_animals(state_equals('Texas', load()))

The answer is only one line!

• Solution is longer
• But parts are reusable

--

Critique: state_equals() is pretty
   specific, we would also need to
   write animal_equals().

What if we make it general?

def field_equals(field, value, rows):
    matches = []
    for row in rows:
        if row[field] == value:
            matches.append(row)
    return matches

# Print the state animal of Texas.
print_animals(field_equals(0, 'Texas', load()))

--

We can do the same
thing for print!

def print_field(i, rows):
    for row in rows:
        print(row[i])

# Print the state animal of Texas.
print_field(1, field_equals(0, 'Texas', load()))

--

See `animal_tools.py`!

import animal_tools as a

# Print the state animal of Texas.
a.print_field(1, a.field_equals(0, 'Texas', a.load()))

# Print the state animal of Virginia.
a.print_field(1, a.field_equals(0, 'Virginia', a.load()))

# Print every state whose animal is the “Beaver”.
a.print_field(0, a.field_equals(1, 'Beaver', a.load()))

# Print every animal that is some kind of “seal”.
a.print_field(1, a.field_endswith(1, 'seal', a.load()))

# Print every animal that is some kind of “whale”.
a.print_field(1, a.field_endswith(1, 'whale', a.load()))

# Print every state whose animal is some kind of “bear”.
a.print_field(0, a.field_endswith(1, 'bear', a.load()))


Programmers call this
“factoring out” common code

(Think of canceling common
 factors in math class!)


We have “refactored” the code:
 rearrange WITHOUT changing
    what the code does!



"Library" = collection of functions (or
       of even fancier things like classes).
       Examples: “animal_tools.py”, “csv”

"API" = Application Programmer Interface
        List of functions and arguments
        Contract: between library and uses it



====
Plan

Monday: we will learn how
  to download web pages and
  parse their content using
  methods like .split()!

Today: work on Lesson 8 and
  Synth/gain.py
