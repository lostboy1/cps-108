“Attendance” — you *get credit*
 for a successful commit from
 *either* Wednesday or Friday



Lesson 5,
Exercise 1:
How long does

  folks: “encoding=”!)



from time import time
t = time()
...
print(time() - t)



Counts from 1970 January 1
 the year the UNIX system
      was launched

    (The ancestor of
    macOS, Linux, BSD!)

And be sure to commit *and*
