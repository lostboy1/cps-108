====================================
How To Run A Program (in your head!)
====================================

• Grab a pencil and paper
• Divide the paper into two columns, like this:
  ┌──────┬───────┐
  │ Name │ Value │
  ├──────┼───────┤
  │      │       │
  │      │       │
  └──────┴───────┘
• Start at the top of the program
• Look up the first statement in the guide below
• After you have run a statement, go to the next
• When you reach the bottom, you’re done!

================
Import Statement
================

import csv

• Add the name (like “csv”) to your sheet
  of paper, if it is not already present.
• Next to the name, write the value
  “<module csv>” to represent access to all
  the functions in that module.

===============
Print Statement
===============

print('Hello, world!')
print(x + 2)

• Compute the value in the parenthesis,
  looking up the value of any names on your
  piece of paper.
• The result gets printed to the screen.

====================
Assignment Statement
====================

animal = 'Ring-tailed cat'
x = x + 1

• Compute the value of the Right Hand Side,
  looking up the value of any names on your
  piece of paper.
• If the name (like “animal” or “x”) is
  already on the sheet of paper, cross out
  its old value; otherwise, add the name.
• Write the new value next to the name

============
If Statement
============

if x > 5:
    print('Warning, more than five.')

• Compute the result of the “if” test,
  looking up the value of any names on your
  piece of paper.
• If the test is true, run the code block.
• If the test is false, skip the code block.

if x > 5:
    print('Warning, more than five.')
else:
    print('Less than five.')

• (Same as above.)
• But if the test is false, run the “else” block.

========
For Loop
========

for state, animal in csv.reader(file):
    print(animal)

for animal in animal_list:
    print(animal)

• Add the names between “for” and “in”
  to your piece of paper if they are not
  there already.
• Find the list or file being looped over.
• For each item, cross out the current value
  of each name, write the new item next to them
  instead, then run the block of code.
• When you’re out of items, the “for” loop is
  done and you can continue to the next statement
  that’s indented at the same level as the “for”.

===========
Method Call
===========

animals.append('Moose')

• Find the first name (that’s left of the “.”)
  on your sheet of paper; it should have a
  data structure (like a list) drawn next to it.
* Depending on the rules of the data structure,
  make the alteration described by the method.
