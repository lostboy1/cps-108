Here’s the steps you will take
at the beginning of each class to download the new assignment,
and to save your work at the end of each class period.

These steps should work fine
if VS Code, git, Python, and the Notebook are properly installed!
If you suspect that something is not properly installed,
check out our course

or
[Windows Install Guide](https://learn.bluffton.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=246281)
for help.

1. **Run VS Code.**
   Type “code” into the search field
   (in Windows, it’s in the lower-left corner of the screen;
   on Mac, you bring it up by typing Command-Space)
   and press Enter when you see the name “Visual Studio Code” come up.

2. **Open the folder that holds your clone of the course materials.**

   * Usually VS Code remembers the folder you had open last time,
     and in the Explorer
     (the left panel whose symbol is at the very top)
     you will already see files like `lesson-01.ipynb`
     and `lesson-02.ipynb`.
     In that case you are ready to start!

   * Or the Explorer will say “No folder opened”
     in which case you should click the “Open Folder” button
     and select the folder that’s your clone of your GitHub repository.
     On the Windows machines in the lab you will hopefully find it
     on your `H:`.

   * If you can’t find your previous clone of the repository,
     just make a new one!
     Ctrl-Shift-P “Clone” should bring up the Git: Clone tool
     where you can paste in your repository’s URL from GitHub.
     Put the new folder in your Documents on your personal machine,
     or on your `H:` in the college’s cluster.

3. **Pull new course materials from your repository.**
   Ctrl-Shift-P “pull” should let you select Git: Pull.
   If VS Code asks “Would you like Code to periodically run ‘git fetch’?”,
   try answering “Yes”.

4. **Always run the first cell before getting back to work.**
   The `start_lesson(…)` function is what prepares the Notebook
   to give you feedback about your answer to each Exercise.

5. **Work on the Lesson.**
   You can always verify that things are working
   before getting started on each day’s lesson
   by selecting the original `lesson-01.ipynb`,
   pressing Shift-Enter in its first code cell
   and verifying that it replies “Welcome to Lesson 1”.

6. **Save your work** from VS Code at the end of each class!

   * Press Ctrl-S to save the lesson notebook you have been working on.
   * Press Ctrl-Shift-P and type “pull” to run “Git: Pull”.
   * Bring up the source control tool, which is the third sidebar in VS Code.
   * In case the source control tool hasn’t noticed you modified a file,
     click the circle with the arrow up near the top.
   * Move the mouse over the word “Changes”
     and click the “+” button to stage your changes.
   * In the text box above “Changes”
     that says “Message (Ctrl+Enter)”,
     type a short message like “Monday class”
     and press Ctrl-Enter to commit your changes.
     A small blue progress bar will appear momentarily
     as your changes are committed.
   * Press Ctrl-Shift-P and type “push” to run Git: Push.
     A small blue progress bar will appear momentarily
     as your changes are pushed up to GitHub.
   * For extra safety the first few times:
     visit your repository on GitHub
     and verify that it shows that you just updated the source code.
     I will also verify on my end that I see your work —
     always feel free to ping me on Slack if you need me to double-check!

7. If you used a Technology Center machine,
   **turn over the keyboard sign** so it gets cleaned once you leave.
   Thanks!
