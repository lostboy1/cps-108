# VS Code

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
Type “code” into the search field at the lower left corner of your desktop
and see whether VS Code comes up as the first suggestion.
If it does, simply press Enter to launch!

**If it’s not installed, what do I do?**
You can install VS Code for Mac here:
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Git

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
In VS Code, press Command-Shift-P and type “clone”.
If “Git: Clone” comes up as an option,
then git is already successfully installed!

**If it’s not installed, what do I do?**
Happily, installing git is easy —
simply visit this link to download the official installer:
[https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Then, open the Windows command prompt
by typing `cmd` into the search bar at the lower left of your desktop
and pressing Enter,
and run these two commands to tell git
what email address and name to use when it saves your work:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email email@bluffton.edu
```

# Python

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
In VS Code, press Command-Shift-P and type “py sel”
to bring up “Python: Select Interpreter” and press Enter.
After a brief search of your system,
VS Code will show you the Python versions it found.
If Python 3.8 is in the list, then it’s installed!
Highlight it and press Enter to select it so that VS Code uses it.

**If it’s not installed, what do I do?**
You can install Python 3.8 for Windows here:
<https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.5/python-3.8.5-amd64.exe>

In the installer, be sure to click the box “Add Python to PATH”
so that other programs can find Python once it’s installed.

# Python Notebook and nbconvert

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
You can simply re-run this install command,
which installs the library if it is missing,
or else happily reports `Requirement already satisfied`
for every package the notebook needs.
You can launch the Windows command prompt
by typing `cmd` into the search bar at the lower left of your desktop
and hitting Enter,
and can paste a command into the prompt with Ctrl-V:

```
python3 -m pip install --user notebook
```

**What if the Notebook does not start successfully?**
As of early September,
part of the Notebook infrastructure has broken the Notebook in VS Code!
Running this command in the terminal should fix it:

```
python3 -m pip install --user --force-reinstall traitlets==4.3.3
```
