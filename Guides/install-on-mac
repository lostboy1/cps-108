# VS Code

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
Press Command-Space and type “vs code”
and see whether VS Code comes up as the first suggestion.
If it does, simply press Enter to launch!

**If it’s not installed, what do I do?**
You can install VS Code for Mac here:
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Git

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
In VS Code, press Command-Shift-P and type “clone”.
If “Git: Clone” comes up as an option,
then git is already successfully installed!

**If it’s not installed, what do I do?**
There are several ways to install git on a Mac.
Here’s the best one:

1. Visit [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).
2. Select the text of the “Install Homebrew” command
   and press Command-V to copy it to the clipboard.
3. Opening a terminal by pressing Command-Space, typing “term”,
   and pressing Enter.
   A terminal window should open.
   Press Command-V to paste in the Homebrew command
   and Enter to run it.
4. Run `brew install git`.
5. Run these two commands to tell git
   what email address and name to use when it saves your work
   (put in your own name and email):

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL@bluffton.edu
```

Close VS Code, re-launch VS code, and the “Git: Clone” command
should now be available when you press Command-Shift-P.

# Python

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
In VS Code, press Command-Shift-P and type “py sel”
to bring up “Python: Select Interpreter” and press Enter.
After a brief search of your system,
VS Code will show you the Python versions it found.
If Python 3.8 is in the list, then it’s installed!
Highlight it and press Enter to select it so that VS Code uses it.

**If it’s not installed, what do I do?**
You can install Python 3.8 for Mac here:
[https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-macosx10.9.pkg](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-macosx10.9.pkg)

# Python Notebook and nbconvert

**How can you tell whether it’s installed?**
You can run the following install command,
which installs the library if it is missing,
or else happily reports `Requirement already satisfied`
for every package the notebook needs.
You can launch the Terminal by typing Command-Space “term” Enter
and paste a line of text into the terminal with Command-V:

```
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3 -m pip install --user notebook
```

**What if the Notebook does not start successfully?**
As of early September,
part of the Notebook infrastructure has broken the Notebook in VS Code!
Running this command in the terminal should fix it:

```
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3 -m pip install --user --force-reinstall 'traitlets==4.3.3'
```
